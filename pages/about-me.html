        <p>
            My name is Ben Anthony Minervino, I am 21 years old and attend Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) in hopes to graduate from their Business Technology Management program
            with my Bachelor of Commerce. I am from Vaughan, Ontario, Canada and my family is from Italy. I am also an aspiring entrepreneur and my most recent venture, a landscaping company
            called <strong>"Natural Visions Landscaping"</strong> has been a successful business that I have owned for 2 years. I did close it down in September of 2024 because I now want to set my sights
            on business opportunities in the technology field as it aligns with my degree and it is a huge interest of mine. My other interests include video games, photography, business, finance, fitness, sports (hockey, basketball, and soccer),
            and I like to hangout with my Girlfriend Sofia. I am often described as hardworking and ambitious as well as laid back and funny by my friends and family.
